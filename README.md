# Kaizoku.NET 2.0

> [!WARNING]
> The current main branch no longer uses or includes Suwayomi.
> You can test using the **2.0** pre-release Docker tag, but make sure to back up your configuration directory (including the database), as everything will be rewritten.
>
> The migration process has been working so far, but as always, proceed with caution.
>
> We are currently fixing remaining bugs and minor issues before the final 2.0 release. There is no formal 2.0 release available yet.

       <strong>Kaizoku.NET</strong> is a modern fork of the original <strong>Kaizoku</strong> and <strong>Kaizoku Next Gen</strong> by OAE,  built to fill the void and bring a streamlined series manager back to life.<br/>
<strong>What does it do?</strong>  <br/>
When you subscribe to a series, it will automatically download it. Whenever the series is updated in any of your configured providers, new chapters will be downloaded automatically, in a “drop and forget” fashion.

This is a **feature-complete** application (not a preview). While it may contain bugs, it *definitely doesn’t contain spiders*, yet.

## 🎯 What It Does

Kaizoku.NET is a **series manager** that prioritizes simplicity, speed, and reliability, just like the original Kaizoku, but with powerful new features under the hood.

It uses the power of  **MIHON extensions** to connect with multiple sources.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧙‍♂️ **Startup Wizard**  
  Automatically imports your existing library.

- 🔁 **Temporary vs Permanent Sources**  
  - Chapters are only downloaded from **temporary** sources when there is no permanent sources 
  - Auto-deleted if a **permanent** source later provides them.

- 🔎 **Multi-Search & Multi-Linking**  
  Search and link one series to **multiple sources/providers**.

- 📥 **Automatic Downloads, Retries, and Rescheduling**

- 🔄 **Auto-Updates**  
  Extensions are kept up to date.

- 🧹 **Filename Normalization**  
  Rebuild your library easily with consistent naming, that will help you reimport it back when needed.

- 🧾 **ComicInfo.xml Injection**  
  Chapters include rich metadata from the original source.

- 🖼️ **Extras**  
  - `cover.jpg` per series  
  - `kaizoku.json` for full metadata mapping  
  - And much more...

---

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

Kaizoku.NET is composed of:

- **Frontend**: A beautiful UI forked from [Kaizoku Next by OAE](https://github.com/oae/kaizoku/tree/next) (Next.js).
- **Backend**: A custom .NET engine that manages schedules, downloads, and metadata, with a Mihon Bridge that enables the use of Mihon Android extensions.
---

## ⚙️ Issues

- If you encounter any issues, check the `logs` folder. You can review the logs there or upload them to share feedback.

## 🤔 Running Android libraries on .NET, is that possible?

Only the **MIHON** extensions are actively maintained, and they are distributed as Android APKs. So we need to hack around that!

By leveraging the Java/Android bridge originally created by the [Suwayomi](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server) team, and adapting parts of it to fit our use case, including replacing KCEF with JCEF Maven we can generate a Java 8 Android compatibility layer with all required Java dependencies included.

Then use [IKVM](https://github.com/ikvmnet/ikvm) to run this on .NET.

## 🐳 Docker Support

- Available for both `amd64` and `arm64`.

### 📁 Volumes

| Container Path | Description                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `/config`      | Stores application configuration |
| `/series`      | Stores series                    |

---

### 🌐 Ports

| Port  | Service         | Required | Notes                        |
|-------|------------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 9833  | Kaizoku.NET UI   | ✅       | Web interface                |

---

### 👤 Permissions

| Variable | Value | Description                    |
|----------|-------|--------------------------------|
| `UID`    | 99    | Host user ID                   |
| `PGID`   | 100   | Host group ID                  |
| `UMASK`  | 022   | File permission mask (default) |

> Ensure the specified UID and PGID have write access to your mounted `/config` and `/series` directories.

---

### 🌐 Network Mode

It is recommended to use **host networking** for optimal performance when downloading a lot and querying multiple providers in parallel.

---

### 🚀 Example: One-Liner Run Command

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name kaizoku-net \
  --network host \
  -p 9833:9833 \
  -e UID=99 \
  -e PGID=100 \
  -e UMASK=022 \
  -v /path/to/your/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/your/series:/series \
  maxpiva/kaizoku-net:latest
```
Replace /path/to/your/config and /path/to/your/series with real paths on your host.


---

## Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  kaizoku-net:
    container_name: kaizoku-net
    image: 'maxpiva/kaizoku-net:latest'
    volumes:
        - '/path/to/your/series:/series'
        - '/path/to/your/config:/config'
    environment:
        - UMASK=022
        - PGID=100

## 🖥️ Desktop App

- A **tray application** based on Avalonia is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/maxpiva/Kaizoku.NET/releases).
- Currently tested only on **Windows**. Testers for Linux and macOS are welcome, as I’m unable to verify it myself.

---

## 🧱 Build It Yourself

It should be straightforward to build.  
Documentation coming soon™ (once laziness subsides).

---

## ⚠️ Resource Usage

Be aware: **Kaizoku.NET** can be **memory-intensive**, especially when managing large libraries or doing parallel searches and downloads.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

### Frontend Devs ! You're Needed 🙏  
Help clean up the mess left behind by our overenthusiastic friend, GitHub Copilot.

### Backend Devs ! PRs Welcome  
This was a **rushed 1-month project**. There are known race conditions and an import system that’s... let’s say *aggressively functional*.  
PRs are welcome to improve stability and architecture.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Brace Yourself

This app *just works™*  until it doesn't. But it's here.
Start managing your series with the style it deserves.
