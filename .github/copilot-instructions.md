# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- Always maintain a document detailing controller endpoint and model changes during this migration.
- Minimize questions and focus on direct actions; "ask less, do more."
- When searching within the repo, include a `*.cs` filter to avoid scanning binaries.
- Run direct commands without wrapping them in try/finally shells.
